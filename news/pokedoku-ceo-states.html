                Pokedoku has taken the WPL by storm, usually propagating quickly within the locker rooms of the WPL teams. 
                <br><br>
                The game combines the cult classics, Sudoku and Pokemon, and gives users a new way to flex their knowledge of nich√© pokemon typings.
                <br><br>
                Qwilfish states: "Oricorio is honestly pretty broken. More people should be using them for their guesses."
                <br><br>
                The game however has a few issues that players would like to see resolved. One of the gripes amoungst players is that the categories are a little narrow, and a tad repetitive.
                <br><br>
                Indeedee quotes: " It's a lot easier to find out Galar guesses by typing in "Galar" and just picking from the list."
                <br><br>
                Arcanine echoed this sentiment: "Revaroom has been on the board for like, three days in a row."
                <br><br>
                But ultimately the penultimate gripe comes from the old timers playing the game: There's just so many Arceus-damn Pokemon now. And with so few guesses, the feeling of seeing a half filled board is just... Well, unfulfilling. 
                <br><br>
                Pelliper says "I just want more than 9 guesses. Also Gen 3 was the last good gen. Fight me."
                <br><br>
                Players of the game have proposed a system in which guesses are unlimited, but your score consistently decreases. That would open up the player to completing each daily puzzle, and not having to hang their head in shame when they don't have screenshots to share with their pals.
                <br><br>
                "And quite frankly, what good is the uniqueness score if it doesn't actually do anything for your final score? What's the point of being special if it doesn't do anything to help me?" - Annihilape
                <br><br>
                Pokedoku CEO responds to players in his usual and cold fashion... Not at all. Their cries fall on deaf ears, and players are left to simply Google on the next tab before they put in their answers so they don't look like washed up Gen Wunners.
                <br><br>
                "Is it embarrassing? Sure... But not as embarrassing as sending in a half filled out board just because I don't know the one Ghost/Normal Pokemon." - Tinkaton
