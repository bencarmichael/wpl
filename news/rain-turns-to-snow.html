                The Sootopolis Super Woopers continue into week 12 with a dissapointing (2-9) record. Gym Leader Sven reports: 
                "We blew a lot of the teams' scouting budget on what we thought would be a winning combination of Barreskewda and Torkoal, however, they both failed to find a foothold in the league. Unfortunately, there's lots of good talent out there, and the weaknesses were a little too exploitable."
                <br><br>
                The two Pokemon were reported to be at odds with one another; teammates alledge:
                "They both wanted to be the sweepers, but with the rain, Torkoal couldn't reach his full potential, and without the rain, Barreskewda wasn't fast enough to go for the OHKOs."
                <br><br>
                "Torkoal would go on to find a new home with the Bama Beatdown." PSPN states. 
                <br><br>
                Barreskewda was released as a free agent to make room for Barack Abomasnow, a Mt. Coronet native. With this change, we can expect to see a change in the weather that the Sootywoops have relied on thusfar. Barack brings with him the ability Snow Warning, which will change the weather from rain, to snow. A new weather pattern is incoming, will it be enough to turn the season around?
                <br><br>
                In addition to Abamasnow, two more Ice focused Pokemon join the Sootopolis Super Woopers: Cetitan and Beartic, both here to play in the slush.
                <br><br>
                Gym Leader Sven released in a post game interview: " It's been a real drag of a season thusfar, so these changes are long overdue. The team has done their best, but the chemistry has been off by a millimeter, and that's all the difference it takes in a best of 3 match. Hopefully the scouting we have conducted will be enough to give us some hope in the back half of the season."
                This week Sven faces against his rival, Yoshuwah, of the Cinnabar RK-9s. The staple Arcanine, Mimikyu, and Gargancl all have options that could lead to a world of hurt for the Woops, but GL Sven says he is "hopeful the avalanche will snuff out the flames."
